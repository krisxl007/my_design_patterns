Proxy Pattern: An object(proxy object) representing another object(target object), so do not need to modify target object at all.

Type of proxy pattern:
- static proxy: solution as below, the problem is too many proxies to create and manage.
    - implements same interface
    - extends target object
- dynamic proxy: do not need to create proxy object(create in runtime), only delta need to be added.
    - JDK(Interface) proxy
    - CGLIB proxy
