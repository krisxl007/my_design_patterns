In order to use simple factory design pattern, you need at least the following classes:

1. Either an Interface or an Abstract Class
2. At least two classes that either implement or extend the interface or base class respectively
3. The factory class itself ï¿½ it should have a static method

*Use case: when the logic is too complex in constructor when creating an instance
