Similar to the Factory/Factory Method/Abstract Factory pattern, Builder pattern is a creation design pattern to create objects.
Factory pattern is considering create object by one step, while builder pattern is creating object step by step.

Consider to use builder pattern when hit below situation:
1. create a complex object(with a lot of mandatory and optional variables) and you don't want multiple constructors
2. create a immutable object
