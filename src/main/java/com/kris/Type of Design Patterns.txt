Creational design patterns:
===========================
- Abstract Factory: Creates an instance of several families of classes
- Builder: Separates object construction from its representation
- Factory Method: Creates an instance of several derived classes
- Prototype: A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- Singleton: A class of which only a single instance can exist
* Object Pool: Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use


Structural design patterns:
===========================
- Adapter: Match interfaces of different classes
- Bridge: Separates an object’s interface from its implementation
- Composite: A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- Decorator: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- Facade: A single class that represents an entire subsystem
- Flyweight: A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- Proxy: An object representing another object
* Private Class Data: Restricts accessor/mutator access


Behavioral design patterns:
===========================
- Chain of responsibility: A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- Command: Encapsulate a command request as an object
- Interpreter: A way to include language elements in a program
- Iterator: Sequentially access the elements of a collection
- Mediator: Defines simplified communication between classes
- Memento: Capture and restore an object's internal state
- Observer: A way of notifying change to a number of classes
- State: Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
- Strategy: Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
- Template method: Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
- Visitor: Defines a new operation to a class without change
* Null Object: Designed to act as a default value of an object
